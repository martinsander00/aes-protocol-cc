# AES Encryption/Decryption Utility

This command-line utility facilitates encrypting and decrypting text using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with support for 128, 192, and 256-bit key lengths.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- A C++11 or newer compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Build
Compile the project with:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o protocol protocol.cc
```
### Usage
Run the Program:
```bash
./protocol
```

Follow the prompts to enter your message, key, and key length (128, 192, or 256 bits) to perform encryption or decryption.
